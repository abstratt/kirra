Kirra API
=====================

The Kirra API is a minimalistic API specification to access functionality of a business application.

Entity instances in the application are accessed via the Instance class.

Entity metadata is available via the Entity class. Further metadata can be obtained via related objects, such as Properties, Relationships, Operations etc.

The InstanceManagement API gives CRUD access to entity instances, including relationship traversal, and provides a mechanism for invoking operations (including actions and queries).  

The SchemaManagement API gives access to the schema of the application.

This API specification has no dependencies.
